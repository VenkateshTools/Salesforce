Ever heard the saying that a blacksmith’s house has only wooden spoons? No? Well Square Peg is a classic example. The staff have been so busy supporting their customers that they haven’t had time to migrate their own critical back office systems to the cloud. The project management and billing systems are still maintained on premise. Worse yet, Round staff have no direct access. #notWinning

This is something that Round plans to help Square Peg with, but that’s a long-term project. In the meantime, the best Round can do is to build a variety of SOAP, REST, and OData web services to allow external integrations.
